1. Which register number is used for the stack pointer (sp) in OS/161?
	$29
2. What bus/busses does OS/161 support?
	LAMEbus
3. What is the difference between splhigh and spl0?
	splhigh sets spl to the highest value, disabling all interrupts
	spl0 sets spl to 0, enabling all interrupts
4. Why do we use typedefs like u_int32_t instead of simply saying "int"?
	It ensures that it is a 32-bit unsigned integer
5. What does splx return?
	The old interrupt state / old spl level
6. What is the highest interrupt level?
	15
7. How frequently are hardclock interrupts generated?
	100 times a second
8. What functions comprise the standard interface to a VFS device?
	d_open, d_close, d_io, d_ioctl
9. How many characters are allowed in a volume name?
	32
10. How many direct blocks does an SFS file have?	
	15
11. What is the standard interface to a file system (i.e., what functions must you implement to implement a new file system)?
	fs_sync, fs_getvolname, fs_getroot, fs_unmount
12. What function puts a thread to sleep?
	void thread_sleep(const void *addr);
13. How large are OS/161 pids?
	32 bits
14. What operations can you do on a vnode?
	vop_open, vop_close, vop_reclaim, vop_read, vop_readlink, vop_getdirentry, vop_write, vop_ioctl, vop_stat, vop_gettype, vop_tryseek, vop_fsync, vop_mmap, vop_truncate, vop_namefile, vop_creat, vop_symlink, vop_mkdir, vop_link, vop_remove, vop_rmdir, vop_rename, vop_lookup, vop_lookparent
15. What is the maximum path length in OS/161?
	1024
16. What is the system call number for a reboot?
	8
17. Where is STDIN_FILENO defined?
	~/cs161/src/kern/include/kern/unistd.h
18. Is it OK to initialize the thread system before the scheduler? Why or why not?
	Yes. The default scheduler is very simple, just a round-robin run queue, while the thread system just intializes the initial thread. 
19. What is a zombie?
	Zombies are threads/processes that have exited but not been fully deleted yet.
20. How large is the inital run queue?
	32
21. What does a device name in OS/161 look like?
	The name of a device is always just "device:". The VFS layer puts in the device name for us, so we don't need to do anything further.	
22. What does a raw device name in OS/161 look like?
	Raw is at the end of the name e.g.: "lhd0raw"
23. What lock protects the vnode reference count?
	vn_countlock
24. What device types are currently supported?
	Block and character device types
